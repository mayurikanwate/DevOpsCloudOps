# DevOpsCloudOps
DevOpsCloudOps is a dummy project designed to simulate real-world DevOps and Cloud practices by implementing a fully automated CI/CD pipeline, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and monitoring setup on Azure Cloud. 

The repository is structured as follows:
ðŸ“‚ infrastructure/ â€“ Terraform and Ansible scripts for infrastructure provisioning.  
ðŸ“‚ src/ â€“ Source code for the sample application.
ðŸ“‚ ci-cd/ â€“ CI/CD pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions/Jenkins).
ðŸ“‚ monitoring/ â€“ Configuration files for Prometheus & Grafana.
ðŸ“‚ scripts/ â€“ Utility scripts for automation and deployment.
ðŸ“‚ docs/ â€“ Project documentation, including setup guides and architecture diagrams.
ðŸ“„ README.md â€“ Overview, setup instructions, and usage details.

Tech Stack:

CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Jenkins
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform & Ansible
Cloud Provider: Microsoft Azure
Orchestration: Kubernetes (AKS)
Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus & Grafana
Goals:
âœ… Automate infrastructure deployment using Terraform
âœ… Set up an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for application deployment
âœ… Implement centralized monitoring and logging for performance tracking
âœ… Showcase hands-on DevOps expertise
